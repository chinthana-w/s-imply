Inspect the current implementation of the S-Imply project and update `docs/paper_draft.tex` to accurately reflect any changes. Strictly adhere to academic writing conventions throughout.

## Your task

1. **Read the current paper** at `docs/paper_draft.tex` in full.

2. **Inspect the implementation** — read these files and extract exact parameters, formulas, and algorithmic decisions:
   - `src/ml/core/model.py` — architecture dimensions, layer counts, head counts, embedding sizes
   - `src/ml/core/loss.py` — all loss components, weights, gate formulas
   - `src/ml/train.py` — hyperparameters, optimizer, curriculum schedule, annealing
   - `src/atpg/ai_podem.py` — PODEM integration, fallback logic
   - `src/atpg/recursive_reconv_solver.py` — `HierarchicalReconvSolver` algorithm
   - `src/atpg/reconv_podem.py` — `PathConsistencySolver`, `pick_reconv_pair`
   - `src/ml/core/dataset.py` — dataset structure, anchor injection, curriculum phases
   - `src/ml/data/embedding.py` — DeepGate embedding dimensions

3. **Identify discrepancies** between the paper text and the actual implementation. Look for:
   - Wrong numerical values (dimensions, weights, counts, thresholds)
   - Incorrect algorithmic descriptions (wrong aggregation method, wrong formula structure)
   - Missing loss terms or components
   - Curriculum or training schedule described differently from code
   - Gate logic formulas that don't match the implementation

4. **Update only the sections that are wrong or outdated.** Do not rewrite sections that are accurate. Do not add new sections unless critical information is entirely absent.

5. **Write in precise academic style**: use correct mathematical notation, passive voice where appropriate, and no informal language. All equations must match the implementation exactly.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, focus your updates on that aspect of the paper (e.g., "loss function", "architecture", "curriculum"). Otherwise perform a full audit.
